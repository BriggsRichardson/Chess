Chess Game, with a Graphical User Interface written in Java.
The game offers two modes, 1) vs. Human 2) vs. Computer

How to setup
------------
I included all the source files (.java) in the src directory. I already compiled the files, and stored the output 
files (.class) into the bin directory. To run the program, you can simply execute the InitiateProgram.class
file in the bin directory.

In a terminal -> cd into the bin directory -> execute the command "java InitiateProgram"
I used java 14 to compile and run the program, if you have another java jdk, feel free to re-compile the source 
files.

Background 
----------
I wrote this program during my Sophomore year as a CS student. It was my first offical personal project. During 
the process of developing this chess program, I learned the basics of GUI event-driven programming,
the importance of the structure and architecture of a program as well as the communication between different 
objects (their data), recursion, and artificial intelligence.

The artificial intelligence started with random moves, but transitioned to the minimax algorithm with 
alpha-beta pruning. The engine thinks 4 moves ahead, and is not as fast as desired. The project taught
me the importance of algorithms, and how they drastically change the performance of run-time performance.
Not only this, but also how the the size of the data you manipulate with algorithms also makes a considerable
difference. 

Moving forward from this program, I applied better planning and more careful selection of algorithms / data
structures for my current projects. I do plan on eventually re-designing this project in C++ to test how strong
I can make the AI.

Ending Note
-----------
Thank you for looking at my chess project. It was really fun to make, as it challenged me logically (rules of chess),
and graphically (first GUI).

Please let  me know if there are any bugs, or if you have any questions.
